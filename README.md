# Push-Ups Chart

[Use The App](https://konstiv23.github.io/push-ups-chart)

This app charts how many push-ups you do per day with a moving average (MA) to focus on maintaining good numbers over longer periods of time, instead of obsessing with missed days and absolute records.

Stack:

- TypeScript
- Redux, Redux Toolkit (an overkill for this app, but whatever)
- Recharts
